# Chapter 10 Makefile
#   - Builds both in-proc and out-of-proc servers
#
# The real work is done in the file MAKE-ONE.
# The first command below calls that file to build the in-proc server.
# The second command below builds the out-of-proc server.
# Either command can be used separately to build just one server.
#
always:
	echo First pass
	nmake -f make-one
	echo Second pass OUTPROC=1
	nmake -f make-one OUTPROC=1
